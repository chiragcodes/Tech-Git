Stashing changes


-> Git's stashing feature allows you to save your local changes temporarily and switch to another branch.


# Usage: git stash push [-u] [<message>]

git stash push
# Creates a new stash

git stash push -u
# Creates a new stash, including untracked files

git stash push "Bugfix WIP"
# Creates a new stash with the message "Bugfix WIP"


Note:
You can omit the push sub-command when using git stash.
Additionally, you might have seen git stash save being used in older versions of Git. This command is now deprecated in favor of git stash push.



Listing stashes


-> Stashes are stored as a stack, with the most recent stash at the top. You can view a list of all stashes using the git stash list command.


# Usage: git stash list

git stash list
# stash@{0}: WIP on patch-1: ee52eda Fix network bug
# stash@{1}: WIP on master: 2b1e8a7 Add new feature



Viewing stash changes


-> This command displays the changes introduced by the stash relative to the parent commit. You can provide the stash reference to view a specific stash, or omit it to view the latest stash.


# Usage: git stash show [<stash>]

git stash show
# Displays the changes in the latest stash

git stash show stash@{1}
# Displays the changes in the stash with the reference stash@{1}



Applying a stash


-> This command applies the changes from the specified stash to the working directory. You can provide the stash reference to apply a specific stash, or omit it to apply the latest stash.


# Usage: git stash apply [<stash>]

git stash apply
# Applies the latest stash

git stash apply stash@{1}
# Applies the stash with the reference stash@{1}


Similarly, you can use the git stash pop command to apply the changes from the specified stash and remove it from the stash list.

# Usage: git stash pop [<stash>]

git stash pop
# Applies the latest stash and removes it from the stash list

git stash pop stash@{1}
# Applies the stash with the reference stash@{1} and
#  removes it from the stash list



Deleting stashes


-> This command removes the specified stash from the stash list.

# Usage: git stash drop <stash>

git stash drop
# Deletes the latest stash

git stash drop stash@{1}
# Deletes the stash with the reference stash@{1}


Moreover, you can delete all stashes using the git stash clear command.

# Usage: git stash clear

git stash clear
# Deletes all stashes
